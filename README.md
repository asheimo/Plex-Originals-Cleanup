# Plex-Originals-Cleanup

This tool allows you to remove extra files from your movie folders so that when you store your original rips you are only storing the main title. THis is based on using a folder of movie folders i.e. <transcoded titles>/<movie>

When you run the tool select the folder you want to examine. Then get the results. Select the ones you want to remove or right-click and choose select all. Then remove the selected files.

It is assumed that you are using the method of a folder for each movie and each item gets a suffix that describes the file i.e. -featurette, -trailer, -short, etc.
